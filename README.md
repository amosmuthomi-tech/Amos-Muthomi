## 👨🏽‍💻 About Me

I’m **Muthomi Amos Muriungi**, a **Data Engineer, Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Machine Learning Engineer, and Business Analyst** committed to transforming complex data into **strategic intelligence and measurable impact**.  

Over the years, I’ve **led nationwide analytics programs**, **designed end-to-end data pipelines**, **built machine learning models**, and **developed interactive Power BI dashboards** that drive **policy, strategy, and innovation**.  

With expertise in **Python, R, SQL, Scala, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau**, I specialize in turning **raw, messy datasets** into **clear, actionable insights** that solve real business problems.  

To me, **data is more than numbers** — it’s the *language of decisions*.  
I build systems that **bridge the gap between data and business** by making complex findings **understandable, impactful, and decision-ready**.  

💡 **My Philosophy:**  
> *Dashboards and reports show the what. I build systems that reveal the why — and guide the how.*

## 🌱 My Journey

Business leaders don’t just need predictions, they need **clarity rooted in statistical rigor**. That conviction began with my foundation in **Economics and Statistics**, where I mastered modeling uncertainty, hypothesis testing, regression, time-series analysis, and probabilistic inference.

That realization pushed me to focus on analytics and business intelligence. Now, my daily work revolves around:

- **📊 Data Analyst**  
  Cleaning messy data, writing high-performance SQL, and conducting **statistically significant** exploratory analysis using p-values, confidence intervals, and correlation

- **📈 Business Intelligence Analyst**  
  Designing Power BI dashboards that embed **statistical KPIs**, trend tests, and forecast accuracy to enable real-time, evidence-based decisions

- **🎯 Business Analyst**  
  Bridging strategy and data by defining measurable KPIs, running A/B tests, cohort analysis, and ROI modeling aligned with business goals

- **🧱 Data Engineer**  
  Building automated, scalable ETL/ELT pipelines (Python, Airflow, AWS/GCP) that ensure **data integrity and reproducibility** at scale

- **🤖 Data Scientist**  
  Developing **statistically validated** ML models — ARIMA, Prophet, XGBoost, neural networks — with cross-validation, residual diagnostics, and performance metrics

- **🚀 Machine Learning Engineer**  
  Deploying production-grade models with MLOps, monitoring drift using **statistical process control**, and optimizing for real-world impact

Today, **statistics is my compass**. From policy analytics to AI automation, I don’t just deliver insights — I deliver **statistically sound, actionable confidence**.

💡 **Mission:** Transform raw data into actionable clarity — empowering leaders to make decisions with insight, not instinct.
